## Use when
- The task matches this domain: Conversion Rate Optimisation audit for any website. Use after a website is built (or to audit an existing client site) to identify and prioritise conversion improvements. Covers heuristic evaluation, split-test-proven rules (Brunson), attention flow, CTA scoring, form audit, trust signal gap analysis, mobile usability, and hypothesis generation for A/B tests. Outputs docs/cro-audit-report.md.
- The user needs evaluation, findings, prioritization, or remediation guidance.

## Do not use when
- The user needs direct implementation instead of an audit.
- There is no target artifact or change set to inspect.

## Required inputs
- The site, page, skill, or workflow being audited.
- Any business goals, constraints, or supporting evidence available for prioritization.

## Workflow
1. Define the audit scope and what success or risk means in context.
2. Inspect the target using the relevant checklist and preserved guidance.
3. For ecommerce, premium, or revenue-critical sites, classify each finding by
   motivation, relevance, clarity, anxiety, friction, or distraction before recommending
   the fix.
4. Summarize the highest-value findings with clear reasoning.
5. Prioritize remediation so the next actions are obvious.

## Quality standards
- Findings must be evidence-based and ordered by impact.
- Recommendations should be specific enough to implement.
- The audit should reduce risk or ambiguity for the next person acting on it.

## Anti-patterns
- Do not provide generic checklist output with no prioritization.
- Do not hide high-severity issues in vague language.
- Do not imply certainty when evidence is missing.

## Outputs
- Audit report, prioritized findings, remediation notes, or approval status.

## References
- Start with `references/legacy-guidance.md` when you need the preserved detailed instructions from the previous skill version.
- Use `references/evidence-led-conversion-system.md` for premium CRO, ecommerce CRO,
  checkout audits, conversion backlog creation, or any audit where analytics and
  business impact matter.
- Read only the specific files under `references/` that match the current task instead of loading the whole directory.
- This skill has no bundled scripts by default; keep execution focused on the documented workflow and any existing project files.

## Notes
- Treat this `SKILL.md` as the portable execution layer for both Claude Code and Codex.
- Preserve existing project behavior unless the current task explicitly requires a change.
