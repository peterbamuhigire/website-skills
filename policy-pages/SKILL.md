name: policy-pages
description: Design Privacy Policies and Terms of Use that are legally compliant, user-friendly, accessible, and trustworthy. Use when building any website to ensure proper legal protection, regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, PIPEDA, LGPD), and user trust through clear, plain-language documents. Covers design patterns, placement strategies, implementation examples, and jurisdiction-specific requirements. Every website needs both documents.

# Policy Pages Skill

Design Privacy Policies and Terms of Use that build user trust while protecting your business legally.

## Why Policies Matter

Two distinct purposes:

1. **Legal Protection** — Legally binding agreements and disclosures protecting your business
2. **User Trust** — Transparent communication showing respect for user data and rights

Generic, dense legal jargon kills trust. Modern policies must be: plain language, visually scannable, accessible, mobile-optimized, and contextual (information where users need it).

## Privacy Policy vs Terms of Use

| Document | Purpose | Legal Basis | Audience |
|----------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Privacy Policy** | What data you collect, how you use it, how you protect it, user rights | GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, PIPEDA, LGPD, Privacy Act 1988, PECR | Everyone (required by law in most jurisdictions) |
| **Terms of Use** | Rules governing website use, liability limits, dispute resolution | Contract law, consumer protection, ToS enforceability | Every website visitor (required to be binding) |

## Privacy Policy

### What to Include

Every privacy policy must address these 15 essential elements:

1. **Document identification** — When it was last updated
2. **Company information** — Legal name, physical address, contact info
3. **Information collected** — Data categories (name, email, IP, cookies, etc.)
4. **How information is collected** — Forms, cookies, pixels, third-party sources
5. **How information is used** — Service delivery, marketing, analytics, legal compliance
6. **Legal basis for processing** — Consent, contract, legal obligation, legitimate interest
7. **Data retention** — How long you keep each data type
8. **Third-party sharing** — Who you share with (vendors, advertisers, law enforcement)
9. **User rights** — Access, correction, deletion, portability, opt-out rights (varies by jurisdiction)
10. **Cookies and tracking** — What cookies you use, how to manage them
11. **Children's privacy** — COPPA requirements if collecting data from under-13s
12. **Security measures** — How you protect data (encryption, access controls)
13. **International transfers** — If collecting data globally (GDPR implications)
14. **Contact information** — How to reach your Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required
15. **Policy updates** — How you notify users of changes

### Design Principles

**Plain Language:**
- ❌ "We may leverage third-party intermediaries to facilitate data provisioning and orchestrate analytical aggregation"
- ✅ "We work with Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site"

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Use headings consistently (h2 for sections, h3 for subsections)
- Bold key terms when first introduced
- Use bullet points for lists (never paragraph lists)
- Use tables for comparison data (data types and retention periods)
- Add callout boxes for important notices (e.g., "Under GDPR, you have the right to...")

**Scannable Formatting:**
- Max 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- One idea per paragraph
- Use subheadings liberally
- Whitespace between sections
- Summary callout at top: "In short: We collect [X], use it for [Y], keep it [Z] long, and never sell it"

### Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements

**European Union (GDPR)**
- Name and contact info of Data Protection Officer (DPO) or representative
- Explicit consent statement for each processing purpose
- Right to access, correction, deletion, portability, objection
- Data transfer agreements (Standard Contractual Clauses)
- 72-hour breach notification requirement

**United States (CCPA/CPRA)**
- "California residents have the right to know what personal information is collected..."
- Right to delete, right to opt-out of sale, right to non-discrimination
- Notice at collection for each purpose
- Response deadline: 45 days (45-day extension if complex)
- California privacy notice format: specific categories, retention, purposes

**Canada (PIPEDA/PIPEDA-like provincial laws)**
- Express or implied consent required
- Individual must be able to identify purposes before consent
- Right to access and correction
- No use beyond stated purpose without consent

**Australia (Privacy Act 1988, Privacy Act)**
- Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) compliance
- Privacy Policy must be freely available
- Anonymized/de-identified data requirements
- No use/disclosure beyond stated purpose

**Children's Privacy (COPPA - US, similar in EU)**
- If collecting data from under-13s: parental consent required
- Clear statement: "We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13"
- Parental access/deletion rights

**Asia-Pacific (LGPD - Brazil, PDPA - Singapore/Thailand)**
- Transparency and accountability principles
- Lawful basis for processing
- Cross-border transfer restrictions

### Implementation Strategies

**Placement:**
- Footer link (small but always present)
- Separate page: `/privacy` or `/legal/privacy`
- Popup on first visit (optional, not required)
- In-app link (mobile apps must have in-app link)

**Acceptance & Consent:**

For signup forms:
```html
<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="privacy_consent" required>
  I agree to the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
</label>
```

For just-in-time consent (GDPR):
```html
<div class="consent-notice">
  <h3>We use cookies to improve your experience</h3>
  <p>Our cookies help us analyze traffic and personalize content.</p>
  <button onclick="acceptCookies()">Accept</button>
  <a href="/privacy#cookies">Learn more</a>
</div>
```

**Version Control:**
- Add "Last Updated: [DATE]" at top
- Include changelog: "Updated November 2024: Added AI processing section"
- Email notification of major changes (not required, best practice)

## Terms of Use

### What to Include

Every Terms of Use must address these 15+ essential elements:

1. **Acceptance of terms** — "By using this website, you agree to these terms"
2. **Service description** — What you're providing
3. **User eligibility** — Age requirement (13+, 18+, etc.), jurisdiction restrictions
4. **User rights granted** — "You may view and download content for personal use only"
5. **Prohibited uses** — No illegal activity, scraping, harassment, reverse engineering, etc.
6. **Intellectual property** — Copyright, trademarks; users retain content rights
7. **Warranties disclaimer** — "Services provided 'as is' without warranty"
8. **Limitation of liability** — Liability cap (often: not responsible for indirect/consequential damages)
9. **Indemnification** — "You agree to defend us against claims arising from your use"
10. **Termination rights** — "We may terminate your account at any time for any reason"
11. **Privacy/data handling** — Link to Privacy Policy
12. **Third-party links** — "We're not responsible for external sites"
13. **Dispute resolution** — Governing law, arbitration vs. courts, jurisdiction
14. **Severability** — "If one provision is invalid, the rest remains in effect"
15. **Changes to terms** — How you notify users of updates (email, website notice)

### Design Principles

**Multi-Layer Approach:**
- **Layer 1 - Summary:** Callout box with key points (3-5 bullet points)
- **Layer 2 - Full text:** Complete legal terms
- **Layer 3 - Just-in-time:** Context-specific notices (e.g., "By uploading, you grant us license to display" at upload form)

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Numbered or bulleted sections for readability
- Bold key phrases: "**You agree that...**, **we are not liable for...**"
- Use icons or callout boxes to highlight important sections
- Tables for comparison (e.g., user rights vs. company rights)

**Plain Language with Legal Precision:**
- ❌ "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained..."
- ✅ "Even if something else in this agreement says otherwise..."

- ❌ "The Company shall not be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages..."
- ✅ "We're not responsible for lost profits, data loss, or other indirect damages"

### Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

**United States**
- Specify governing law: "These terms are governed by [State] law"
- Arbitration clause: "Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, not court"
- Class action waiver (enforceable in some states, not all): "You waive the right to participate in class action lawsuits"
- Consumer protection: "Nothing here waives rights given to you by law"

**European Union**
- Consumer rights can't be waived (B2C contracts)
- Dispute resolution: "EU residents can use the online dispute resolution platform"
- GDPR link required: "See our Privacy Policy for GDPR rights"
- "Unfair terms" doctrine: terms must be fair and transparent

**United Kingdom**
- Consumer Rights Act: consumer rights can't be waived
- Data protection link required (UK GDPR)
- Plain language requirement: "These terms must be expressed in plain language"

**Canada**
- Specify governing law: typically "laws of [Province], Canada"
- Consumer protection laws vary by province
- Quebec: different civil law system (not common law)

**Australia**
- Australian Consumer Law applies (can't exclude liability for death/injury)
- Competition and Consumer Act requirements
- Specify: "These terms are governed by the laws of [State]"

**Asia-Pacific (Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong)**
- Arbitration clauses common and enforceable
- Specify seat of arbitration and applicable law
- Note: substantive consumer protections may apply regardless of terms

### Implementation Strategies

**Placement:**
- Footer link (required)
- Separate page: `/terms` or `/legal/terms`
- Must-read before signup: require explicit acceptance with checkbox
- In-app: mobile apps must have in-app link

**Acceptance Mechanism:**

Required checkbox at signup:
```html
<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="terms_acceptance" required>
  I have read and agree to the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>
</label>
```

Record acceptance:
```
- timestamp: 2024-11-15T10:30:00Z
- user_id: 12345
- ip_address: 192.168.1.1
- terms_version: 2024-11-15
```

Just-in-time notice (e.g., at file upload):
```html
<div class="notice">
  <strong>By uploading, you agree that:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The content doesn't violate anyone's rights</li>
    <li>We can store and display it</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="/terms#user-content">Full terms</a>
</div>
```

**Version Control:**
- Maintain version numbers: "Terms of Use v3.2 (Updated November 2024)"
- Keep archive of all versions (on `/legal/archive` or similar)
- Notify existing users of material changes (best practice, sometimes required by law)
- Email template: "We've updated our Terms. [Link to what changed]. If you don't agree, you can delete your account."

## Accessibility Requirements

- Use semantic HTML: `<h2>`, `<h3>`, proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text on diagrams (e.g., "Flow chart showing data sharing with payment processor")
- Don't rely on color alone (use text, icons, structure)
- Font: minimum 16px body text, sans-serif preferred
- Line height: minimum 1.5x font size
- Use sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for body text)
- Keyboard navigable: all links clickable via Tab key
- Screen reader compatible: proper ARIA labels on form inputs

## Mobile Optimization

- **Single column layout** on mobile (never horizontal scroll)
- **Responsive text:** use relative units (rem, em, %)
- **Tap targets:** buttons and links minimum 44×44px
- **Touch-friendly:** don't require hover states
- **Progressive disclosure:** collapse sections by default on mobile
- **Print-friendly:** media queries for printing (users print policies often)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Correct Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Dense legal text with no formatting | Headings, bullet points, callout boxes, tables |
| Hiding privacy policy in footer only | Footer link PLUS prominent page at /privacy |
| Copying another company's policy | Customize to YOUR data practices (Google's policy isn't yours) |
| Outdated dates and version numbers | Update date whenever policy changes, even minor ones |
| Broken links to Privacy Policy in ToS | Test all internal links from terms to privacy |
| No way for users to opt-out | Provide opt-out/unsubscribe mechanisms for email/cookies/tracking |
| Policy says one thing, site does another | Audit: does your site match your policy? (e.g., if you say "no tracking," verify no trackers) |
| No acceptance mechanism for ToS | Require checkbox at signup with timestamp record |
| Using overly technical language | Explain technical terms: "**Cookies** are small files stored on your device..." |
| Not accounting for different jurisdictions | Add jurisdiction-specific sections (e.g., "California Residents" section for CCPA) |
