## Our Story

**How did this company start?**
{Tell the origin story — e.g., "In 2010, Peter Mukisa was working as a site engineer for a large construction firm. He noticed that middle-income families in Kampala were being overcharged for low-quality work. With UGX 5 million in savings and one second-hand pickup truck, he started Mukisa Builders with a simple promise: honest work at fair prices. The first project was a two-bedroom extension for a family in Ntinda."}

**What problem were you trying to solve?**
{e.g., "Affordable, quality construction was simply not available for ordinary families in Kampala."}
