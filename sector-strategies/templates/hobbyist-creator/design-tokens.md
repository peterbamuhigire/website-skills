# Hobbyist/Creator: Design Tokens Reference

## Color Philosophy
Authenticity and personality. Bold choices. Reflects creator's actual work. Not generic or corporate.

**Sector Standard:**
- Accent: High-saturation, tied to creator's work (not safe defaults)
- Substrate: Natural, authentic (true whites, warm creams, natural grays)
- Secondary: One complementary color
- No "generic SaaS blue" — be bold

## Typography
- Display fonts: YES, use unconventional fonts
- Serif or sans-serif: Choose what feels true to creator
- Personality in type matters more than convention

## Key Components
- **Portfolio Grid**: Showcase best work prominently
- **Behind-the-Scenes**: Process photos, studio shots, authenticity signals
- **Subscribe/Follow CTA**: Social proof (follower count, community)
- **About Section**: Personal story, why people follow
