## Color Psychology Reference

### Trust Signal Colors

| Color | Psychological Association | Best Practice Areas |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Deep blue | Authority, reliability, trust | All; universal for law |
| Teal | Calm, resolution, cooperation | Family, mediation |
| Navy | Seriousness, strength, protection | Criminal, litigation |
| Charcoal/slate | Sophisticated, modern | Corporate, business |
| Sage green | Growth, healing, resolution | Family, immigration |
| Warm gold | Achievement, premium, legacy | Estate, corporate |
| Terracotta/warm amber | Human, approachable, empathy | Immigration, family |

### Colors to Avoid

| Color | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Bright red as primary | Alarm/danger — wrong for most practices; use only for emergency CTAs |
| Bright orange | Associated with discounts; undermines premium positioning |
| Pure black background | Too aggressive for emotionally distressed clients |
| Lime/neon green | No trust association |
| Generic stock navy + gold | Every other law firm — zero differentiation |

## Spacing and Layout Reference

```css
/* Law firm content pages — wider margins for readability */
.content-max-width: 720px;     /* Readable line length for legal content */
.section-padding: 80px 0;      /* Generous whitespace — authoritative */
.card-padding: 32px;           /* Practice area cards */
.cta-padding: 16px 32px;       /* Consultation CTA button */

/* Mobile */
.mobile-section-padding: 48px 0;
.mobile-font-size: 17px;       /* Minimum — stressed adults need clarity */
.mobile-cta-height: 52px;      /* Tap-to-call and form submit */
```
