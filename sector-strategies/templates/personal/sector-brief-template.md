- `src/styles/global.css` (YOUR visual identity)
- `design-tokens.md` (YOUR design system)

**Key principle: Your personal website should feel distinctly like YOU, not like a template.**

The answers you gave in this brief will drive that uniqueness. Don't skip hard questions. The more specific you are, the more distinctive your final site will be.
