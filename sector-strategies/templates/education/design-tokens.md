# Education: Design Tokens Reference

This file provides sector-standard design tokens for education websites (schools, universities, training institutes).

## Color Philosophy

Education sites succeed when they convey **credibility, safety, and clear structure**. Colors should feel:
- Professional and trustworthy
- Energetic but not chaotic (primary colors for energy, neutrals for stability)
- Accessible (high contrast for readability)

### Primary Palette (Sector Standard)

| Role | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Primary Blue** | #1E40AF | Main CTA, headers, trust |
| **Secondary Green** | #059669 | Accent, success states, positive messaging |
| **Neutral Dark** | #1F2937 | Body text, main headers |
| **Light Gray** | #F9FAFB | Backgrounds, cards |
| **Gold Accent** | #D97706 | Highlights, badges, achievement |

### Usage Rules
- Headers: Primary Blue or Neutral Dark
- CTAs (Enroll, Apply): Primary Blue on white
- Body text: Neutral Dark on Light Gray
- Success/Progress: Secondary Green
- Disabled: 50% opacity gray

## Typography

**Serif**: Georgia or Lora (heritage, trust) for headers
**Sans-serif**: Inter or Poppins (clarity) for body and navigation
**Display**: Playfair Display (one headline accent on hero)

## Key Components (Education-Specific)

### Primary CTAs
- **"Apply Now"** / **"Enroll"**: Primary Blue, large, visible above fold on all pages
- **"Schedule a Tour"**: Secondary CTA, equal prominence
- **"Request Info"**: Tertiary CTA, form trigger
- **"Donate"**: Gold/accent color, fundraising focus

**Best practice**: Use multiple audience-specific CTAs (Students, Parents, Alumni, Donors)

### Page Components
- **Enrollment CTA**: Primary Blue button, 60–80px height on desktop, sticky on mobile
- **Course/Program Cards**: 3–4 per row (responsive 1 mobile), program badge, credit hours, application button
- **Faculty Profiles**: Circular photo (200x200px), name, title, credentials, bio, office hours link
- **Event Calendar**: Grid or list view, clear dates + time, registration CTAs, category badges
- **Testimonials**: Student/parent quote, photo, name, year/role, 3+ star rating
- **Success Stats**: "100% internship placement" style trust-builders, displayed prominently
- **Virtual Tour**: Full-screen video hero + interactive hotspots (click for details)
- **News/Updates**: Blog grid, featured article, recent posts sidebar

### Navigation Patterns
- **Desktop**: Horizontal main nav + dropdown menus for sections (Academics, Admissions, Student Life, About)
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu, simplified dropdowns, sticky mobile nav bar
- **Audience Segmentation**: Consider separate nav paths for Prospective Students / Current Students / Parents / Alumni / Donors

### Color Accent Strategy
- **Gold badges**: Achievement, completion, special programs (scholarships, honors)
- **Green success**: Admission decisions, completed applications, calendar events
- **Blue actions**: All primary CTAs, clickable elements, links
