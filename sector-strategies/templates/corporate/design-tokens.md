# Corporate & Consulting: Design Tokens Reference

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a REFERENCE palette, not a prescription. Do NOT use these colors/fonts directly. Every corporate website must look different.**

This document shows ONE example of how corporate sites can be designed. Your site should have its own distinctive visual identity.

## Color Philosophy (For Your Customization)

Corporate and consulting sites must balance **authority with approachability and trust**. But what colors achieve this depends entirely on your brand and market position:

### Example Palette (DO NOT USE AS-IS)

- **Deep Navy** (#0F172A): Leadership, stability, enterprise-grade, professionalism
- **Slate Gray** (#64748B): Clarity, sophistication, secondary messaging, data visualization
- **Accent Brand** (#2563EB): Primary CTA, energy, differentiation from competitors
- **Forest Green** (#15803D): Growth, sustainability, positive metrics, success indicators
- **Warm Neutral** (#F5F3FF): Modern minimalism, breathing room, clean interfaces

### Why This Is Just ONE Option

Different corporate markets need different colors:
- **Financial firms**: Often use navy + gold (heritage + prestige), not blue
- **Tech consultants**: Often use black + vibrant accent (cutting-edge), not neutral navy
- **Boutique firms**: Often use warm earth tones (human-focused), not cool navy
- **Established institutions**: Often use charcoal + subtle accent (sophisticated restraint)

Your brand should NOT default to this palette. Answer your sector-brief questions to define YOUR colors.

### Primary Palette (Optimized for Conversion)

| Role | Light | Dark | RGB Light | Usage |
|------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Deep Navy** | #0F172A | #1E293B | 15, 23, 42 | Primary background, headers, hero, trust |
| **Slate Gray** | #64748B | #94A3B8 | 100, 116, 139 | Secondary text, data, metadata |
| **Accent Brand** | #2563EB | #60A5FA | 37, 99, 235 | Primary CTA "Request Demo", highlights |
| **Forest Green** | #15803D | #4ADE80 | 21, 128, 61 | Growth metrics, "ROI", success indicators |
| **Warm Neutral** | #F5F3FF | #F9F5FF | 245, 243, 255 | Card backgrounds, breathing room |
| **Light Gray** | #E2E8F0 | #334155 | 226, 232, 240 | Borders, dividers, subtle elements |
| **Alert Red** | #DC2626 | #F87171 | 220, 38, 38 | Warnings, critical metrics |

### Dark Mode Support

All colors verified for WCAG AAA standard (7:1 contrast) in both light and dark modes. Corporate sites often operate in dark office environments.

### Color Psychology by Company Type

- **Technology/SaaS**: Emphasize Accent Brand + Deep Navy (innovation + stability)
- **Financial Services**: Lead with Deep Navy + Slate Gray (trust + transparency)
- **Consulting/Professional Services**: Use Deep Navy + Accent Brand (authority + innovation)
- **Healthcare/Biotech**: Highlight Forest Green + Deep Navy (health + professionalism)
- **Real Estate/Commercial**: Deep Navy + Accent Brand (establishment + growth)

## Typography (CUSTOMIZE — DO NOT USE THESE FONTS DIRECTLY)

### Example Font Pairing (This Is NOT Your Pairing)

**Serif Example**: Georgia or Lora (DO NOT USE — find your own)
- Headlines: H1–H2
- Long-form content (about, case studies, thought leadership)

**Sans-serif Example**: Inter or Sora (DO NOT USE — find your own)
- Navigation, labels, CTAs, metadata
- Body text on all devices

**Display Example**: Playfair Display (DO NOT USE — find your own)
- Hero headline (company mission, value proposition)
- Section headers (accent use only)

### Why You Need Different Fonts

The design-system skill explicitly forbids Inter, Roboto, and Arial to prevent generic designs. This reference also shows common fonts, but your brand should choose UNIQUE fonts that:
- Reflect your market position (traditional vs. cutting-edge)
- Differentiate from competitors
- Work across all device sizes
- Maintain accessibility (WCAG AA+)

See [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org) for hundreds of distinctive, self-hosted font options.

## Anti-Homogeneity Principle

**Every website built with this system must look visually distinctive.** If two corporate sites both use Deep Navy + Inter + the same component patterns, they become indistinguishable from generic templates.

To ensure your site is unique:

1. **Define YOUR colors** (not these reference colors)
   - Research your competitors' palettes and choose opposite territory
   - Align with your logo (but don't be limited by it)
   - Consider your market: What colors do leaders in your space avoid?

2. **Choose distinctive fonts** (not Inter/Lora/Playfair Display)
   - Start at [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org) or Google Fonts
   - Choose ONE heading font that feels distinctive
   - Choose ONE body font that's invisible (easy to read)
   - Test the pairing across all pages before committing

3. **Build component variations** (not cookie-cutter cards)
   - Design at least 3 button styles (primary, secondary, tertiary)
   - Create 2–3 card layouts for different content types
   - Add visual identity through:
     - Accent element position (lines, dots, shapes)
     - Spacing rhythm (generous vs. tight)
     - Border treatment (none, subtle, bold outline)
     - Corner radius (sharp, subtle, fully rounded)

4. **Use reference sites strategically**
   - Study competitors to understand what you DON'T want
   - Use non-competitors for inspiration (different markets)
   - Borrow patterns, not palettes (good navigation ≠ their colors)

## Reference Sites (For Differentiation Strategy)

Study these to understand corporate site patterns, but DO NOT COPY their aesthetics:
- McKinsey & Company (consulting authority — what NOT to copy)
- Goldman Sachs (dark theme mastery — but find different colors)
- Accenture (enterprise scale navigation — adapt, don't replicate)
- Deloitte (navigation structure — inform yours differently)
- Stripe (minimalist design — use different palette)

Better approach: Find 3 competitors and decide what visual territory they DON'T occupy. Build your site there.
