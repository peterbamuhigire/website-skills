# {Company Name} Sector Brief: Corporate & Consulting

Copy this template to `docs/sector-brief.md` in your client project and answer each section completely. This brief drives differentiation — every answer should point toward what makes THIS company unique, not generic corporate templates.

## Brand Identity & Differentiation

**CRITICAL: What is the ONE thing that makes this company different from competitors?**
(E.g., "We're the only firm that guarantees 30-day ROI", "We've been private for 20 years (no PE ownership)", "We specialize exclusively in African markets")

---

**Who is your ideal customer, and what keeps them up at night?**
- Company size: (SMB, Mid-market, Enterprise)
- Industry vertical: (Finance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Tech, etc.)
- Decision maker: (CFO, CIO, CEO, COO)
- Top 3 pain points: (e.g., "Legacy system debt", "Compliance complexity", "Talent shortage")

**What is the primary emotion you want executives to feel?**
Choose ONE: Confidence | Urgency | Relief | Empowerment | Clarity | Partnership | Security

## Visual Identity — Differentiation Required

**What is your competitive advantage, and how should the visual design reflect it?**

Example differentiation strategies:
- **If you're innovative**: Bold, modern aesthetic (deep blacks + vibrant accent, sharp typography, geometric patterns)
- **If you're established/trustworthy**: Conservative, sophisticated aesthetic (navy/charcoal + gold, serif headers, clean grid)
- **If you're agile/human-focused**: Warm, approachable aesthetic (warm neutrals + bright accent, generous spacing, friendly illustrations)
- **If you're specialized/expert**: Minimalist, data-forward aesthetic (high contrast, monospace accents, precise typography)
