# Travel Branding & Visual Identity

Travel websites sell dreams before destinations. 58%+ of bookings happen on mobile, and visitors decide within 3 seconds whether a site "feels" like the kind of travel they want. Color, typography, and photography are the first trust signals — before a single word is read.

## The Brand Recognition Formula

A signature color increases brand recognition by 80%. For travel brands:

1. **One dominant primary color** — appears in header, CTAs, and brand identity
2. **One high-contrast accent** — appears only on "Book Now" CTA, urgency badges, and pricing highlights
3. **Warm neutrals** — text and backgrounds that feel inviting, not clinical

## Color Psychology for Travel

Research shows specific color hues drive engagement in tourism photography and branding:

| Hue | Psychological Effect | Best For | Avoid When |
|-----|---------------------|----------|------------|
| **Deep Blue** (#1E40AF) | Trust, calm, ocean, sky | Luxury travel, cruise lines, beach resorts | Adventure/adrenaline brands |
| **Emerald Green** (#10B981) | Nature, sustainability, growth | Eco-tourism, safari, rainforest tours | Urban city break brands |
| **Terracotta** (#C97655) | Warmth, earth, authenticity | Cultural tours, African safari, heritage | Modern/tech-forward brands |
| **Sand Gold** (#F59E0B) | Luxury, warmth, exotic | Desert tours, luxury lodges, sunset | Budget/backpacker brands |
| **Adventure Red** (#DC2626) | Energy, passion, urgency | Adventure sports, expedition tours | Wellness/spa retreats |
| **Sky Blue** (#0EA5E9) | Freedom, openness, discovery | General travel, flight booking, island | Rugged/wilderness brands |
| **Deep Teal** (#0D9488) | Sophistication, tropical, modern | Boutique travel, modern eco-lodges | Traditional/heritage brands |
| **Warm Violet** (#7C3AED) | Mystery, culture, spirituality | Cultural immersion, spiritual retreats | Outdoor adventure brands |
| **Sunset Orange** (#EA580C) | Warmth, energy, excitement | Youth travel, backpacking, city breaks | High-end luxury brands |

### Color by Tour Type

| Tour Type | Primary | Accent | Neutral | Reasoning |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Luxury Safari** | Deep Navy | Gold | Cream | Premium, established, exclusive |
| **Budget Backpacker** | Bright Teal | Orange | Light Gray | Energetic, youthful, value |
| **Cultural Immersion** | Terracotta | Warm Gold | Warm White | Authentic, earthy, heritage |
| **Eco-Tourism** | Forest Green | Sky Blue | Sand | Nature, sustainability, trust |
| **Adventure Sports** | Deep Red | Electric Blue | Charcoal | Adrenaline, bold, dynamic |
| **Wellness/Retreat** | Sage Green | Blush Pink | Ivory | Calm, healing, natural |
| **Cruise/Ocean** | Deep Blue | Coral | White | Maritime, tropical, open |
| **City Breaks** | Charcoal | Vibrant Accent | Cool Gray | Urban, modern, sophisticated |
| **Family Travel** | Warm Blue | Sunny Yellow | Soft White | Friendly, safe, fun |

## Competitive Differentiation

**Before choosing colors, audit 5-10 competitor tour operators:**

- If East African safari companies all use green + gold, choose navy + terracotta
- If adventure companies in your market use red + black, choose teal + orange
- If luxury lodges nearby use cream + gold, choose deep blue + copper

**Real examples of differentiation:**
- Much Better Adventures chose bold teal to stand apart from earthy adventure brands
- Cubania Travel uses hot pink + vibrant colors to signal cultural energy vs muted competitors
- Mr & Mrs Smith chose editorial black + cream to position as lifestyle, not booking engine
- Intrepid Travel chose orange-red to signal adventure amongst blue-dominated travel brands

## Typography for Travel

### Font Pairing Principles

Travel sites need **emotional impact first**, then readability:

| Tour Type | Header Font | Body Font | Personality |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Luxury Safari/Lodge** | Elegant serif (Cormorant, DM Serif Display) | Clean sans (DM Sans, Inter) | Premium, refined |
| **Adventure/Expedition** | Bold geometric (Outfit, Sora, Clash Display) | Humanist sans (Nunito, Source Sans Pro) | Bold, energetic |
| **Cultural Immersion** | Distinctive serif (Fraunces, Literata, Lora) | Warm sans (Plus Jakarta Sans, Nunito) | Authentic, warm |
| **Eco-Tourism** | Organic sans (Quicksand, Nunito) | Natural sans (DM Sans) | Approachable, earthy |
| **Wellness/Retreat** | Light serif (Cormorant Garamond, EB Garamond) | Elegant sans (Jost, Outfit) | Calm, refined |
| **Budget/Backpacker** | Bold sans (Rubik, Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans) | Clean sans (Inter, Nunito Sans) | Casual, direct |
| **City Breaks** | Modern sans (Space Grotesk, Satoshi) | Neutral sans (DM Sans) | Urban, contemporary |

**Never use:** Inter alone, Roboto alone, Arial, generic system fonts. These signal "booking engine" not "travel brand."

**Always use Fontsource** for self-hosted fonts — no external CDN requests.

### Typography Scale

| Element | Desktop | Mobile | Weight | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Hero headline | 56-72px | 36-44px | 700-800 | Destination name or emotional hook |
| Section heading | 36-44px | 26-32px | 600-700 | Tour categories, destination sections |
| Card heading | 20-24px | 18-20px | 600 | Tour names, destination names |
| Body text | 16-18px | 15-16px | 400 | Descriptions, itineraries |
| Price display | 28-36px | 24-28px | 700 | Prominent, with currency symbol |
| Small/meta | 13-14px | 12-13px | 400 | Duration, group size, dates |
| CTA button | 16-18px | 14-16px | 600-700 | "Book Now", "Explore Tours" |

## Photography Direction

### The Single Most Important Element

Travel photography is the #1 conversion driver. Younger travellers prefer visual storytelling over text. 360-degree videos and virtual tours increase engagement by 30%+.

### What to Photograph

- **Hero/landscape**: Wide, atmospheric destination shots (golden hour preferred)
- **Experience**: Travellers actively engaged — not posed (kayaking, wildlife watching, cooking)
- **Detail**: Local food, textures, crafts, wildlife close-ups (tactile, sensory)
- **People**: Local guides, hosts, cultural encounters (warm, dignified, natural)
- **Accommodation**: Room interiors, lodge exteriors, pool/view shots
- **Aerial**: Drone shots of landscapes, coastlines, forests (establish scale)

### Photography Rules

- **Always authentic** — stock photos destroy trust instantly in travel
- **Show people IN the experience** — "you could be here" psychology
- **Golden hour priority** — warm, atmospheric light converts better than midday harsh light
- **Consistent editing** — same warmth, contrast, saturation across all images
- **Diverse representation** — reflect your actual traveller demographic
- **High resolution** — minimum 1920px width for hero, 800px for cards
- **Aspect ratios**: 16:9 (hero/landscape), 4:3 (destination cards), 1:1 (experiences/people)

### Video Guidelines

- **Never upload video files to the repo or server** — host on YouTube (free, global CDN)
- Clients upload to their YouTube channel and provide URLs in docs
- Embed via `youtube-nocookie.com` iframe with `loading="lazy"` and descriptive `title`
- Destination videos: 60-90 seconds (highlight reel)
- Tour walkthroughs: 2-3 minutes maximum
- Testimonial videos: 30-60 seconds per person
- Use poster/thumbnail as fallback (save mobile data)
- Muted autoplay only for hero background video; click-to-play elsewhere

## Brand Voice for Travel

| Audience | Tone | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Adventure seekers** | Bold, exciting, empowering | "Climb higher. See further. Live wilder." |
| **Luxury travellers** | Elegant, exclusive, refined | "Where extraordinary becomes your everyday" |
| **Cultural explorers** | Warm, curious, respectful | "Meet the people behind the places" |
| **Eco-conscious** | Purposeful, hopeful, informed | "Travel that gives back more than it takes" |
| **Budget travellers** | Direct, fun, honest | "Epic adventures. Honest prices. No hidden fees." |
| **Families** | Reassuring, fun, practical | "Adventures the whole family will remember" |

### Language Standards (Multi-language)

Following the skill library's language standards:
- **English**: British spelling (programme, colour, organised) for East African operators
- **French**: Formal francophone African French for francophone markets
- **Kiswahili**: East African standard Kiswahili for local-language pages
