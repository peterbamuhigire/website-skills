# Update Claude Documentation

## Use when
- The task matches this domain: "Update project documentation files (README.md, PROJECT_BRIEF.md, TECH_STACK.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/API.md, docs/DATABASE.md, CLAUDE.md) when significant changes occur. Use for feature additions, architecture changes, dependency updates, API/database modifications. Ensures consistency across all docs."
- The user needs repo-maintenance or skill-authoring support rather than project output.

## Do not use when
- A build, writing, or audit skill should own the task instead.
- There is no repository or skill-maintenance action to perform.

## Required inputs
- The files, changes, or workflow that need maintenance.
- Current repository conventions and any behavior that must not regress.

## Workflow
1. Read the current repository state and the exact maintenance goal.
2. Use the preserved guidance and any bundled scripts to perform the minimum effective change.
3. Keep the result aligned with existing repo conventions.
4. Prepare the output so a follow-on safety review or documentation pass is straightforward.

## Quality standards
- Maintenance changes must reduce ambiguity, not add process noise.
- Outputs should preserve portability and existing behavior.
- The result should be easy for another agent to continue using.

## Anti-patterns
- Do not introduce product-specific assumptions into portable skill rules.
- Do not bloat SKILL.md when detail belongs in references or scripts.
- Do not leave partially updated conventions behind.

## Outputs
- Updated skill structure, repo-maintenance changes, authoring guidance, or synchronized documentation.

## References
- Start with `references/legacy-guidance.md` when you need the preserved detailed instructions from the previous skill version.
- Read only the specific files under `references/` that match the current task instead of loading the whole directory.
- This skill has no bundled scripts by default; keep execution focused on the documented workflow and any existing project files.

## Notes
- Treat this `SKILL.md` as the portable execution layer for both Claude Code and Codex.
- Preserve existing project behavior unless the current task explicitly requires a change.
