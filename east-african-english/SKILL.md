# East African English — Language & Tone Skill

All website copy, headings, calls to action, descriptions, and microcopy must follow this style guide. This is the foundational language standard applied before and during every content-writing step.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Clear and direct.** Sentences are straightforward, grammatically careful, and logically structured. No slang in professional communication.
2. **Formal and respectful.** Politeness is essential. Communication shows courtesy and humility.
3. **British English spelling.** organisation, programme, centre, colour, travelling (double "l").
4. **Professionally indirect.** Avoid bluntness. Soften directives with courteous phrasing.
5. **Measured confidence.** Confident without arrogance. No dramatic or exaggerated language.

## British English Standards

### Spelling

Always use British spelling:

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| organisation | organization |
| programme | program |
| centre | center |
| colour | color |
| travelling | traveling |
| specialise | specialize |
| honour | honor |
| favourite | favorite |
| analyse | analyze |
| defence | defense |
| licence (noun) | license (noun) |
| catalogue | catalog |
| enquiry | inquiry |

### Dates

Write dates in day-month-year order:

- 17 February 2026
- 17th February 2026

Never use month-first American format (February 17, 2026).

## Tone by Country Context

When the client is based in a specific country, adjust the tone slightly:

### Uganda — Warm and Relational

- Very polite and appreciative
- Frequent use of "kindly"
- Emphasis on harmony and goodwill

> We highly appreciate your support in this matter.
> Kindly be informed that the funds have been received.

### Kenya — Confident and Business-Oriented

- Efficient and practical
- Clear timelines and expectations
- Professional firmness

> Please share the signed agreement by Friday, 21 February 2026.
> The project remains on schedule.

### Tanzania — Calm and Measured

- Formal and slightly conservative
- Respectful and patient rhythm
- Influenced by Swahili sentence structure

> We kindly request your guidance on the next steps.
> The matter is under review, and we shall revert shortly.

When no specific country is indicated, use the **neutral East African style** — a balanced blend of all three.

## Courteous Phrases to Use

These are natural and expected in East African business English:

- Kindly find attached…
- We kindly request…
- Please be advised that…
- We would like to inform you…
- Thank you for your continued support.
- We look forward to your response.
- We appreciate your partnership.
- Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.

## Vocabulary Standards

### Preferred Professional Words

Use simple, professional vocabulary:

- facilitate, implement, undertake, liaise, coordinate
- engage, support, enhance, review, confirm
- advise, revert (meaning "respond" — widely accepted in East Africa)
- significant, important, strategic, beneficial, valuable

### Words and Phrases to Avoid

Never use exaggerated marketing language:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| groundbreaking | significant |
| revolutionary | innovative |
| game-changing | strategic |
| amazing | commendable |
| awesome | excellent |
| incredible | remarkable |
| unleash | enable |
| skyrocket | improve significantly |
| supercharge | strengthen |
| crushing it | performing well |

Also avoid:

- American slang and casual abbreviations (FYI, ASAP, BTW)
- Overly creative marketing language
- Dramatic emotional tone
- Complex academic vocabulary
- Excessive exclamation marks

Instead of abbreviations, write in full:

> Please respond as soon as possible.

## Sentence Style

### Use Full, Balanced Sentences

- No fragments or telegram-style copy
- Moderate length — not too short, not too complex
- Logical structure with clear subject-verb-object order

Good:

> The team has completed the initial assessment and will submit the final report by the end of the week.

### Professional Indirectness

Soften directives. Never sound blunt or commanding.

| Too Blunt | East African Style |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Send the report today. | Kindly submit the report by close of business today. |
| You are wrong. | There appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the figures provided. |
| We need payment now. | We kindly request that the outstanding balance be settled at your earliest convenience. |
| Fix this immediately. | We would appreciate your urgent attention to this matter. |

### CTAs and Website Microcopy

Apply the same respectful tone to buttons, links, and short UI text:

| Generic | East African Style |
|---------|--------------------|
| Buy Now | Place Your Order |
| Sign Up | Register Today |
| Get Started | Begin Your Journey |
| Learn More | Find Out More |
| Contact Us | Get in Touch |
| Download | Download the Brochure |

Avoid aggressive sales language. CTAs should be inviting, not pushy.

## Openings and Closings (for letters, emails, contact forms)

### Openings

- Dear Sir/Madam,
- Dear Mr. Otieno,
- Greetings,
- We refer to the above subject matter.

### Closings

- Yours faithfully, (when you do not know the recipient)
- Yours sincerely, (when you know the recipient)
- Kind regards,
- Best regards,

Often followed by:

> We look forward to your favourable response.

## Reference Paragraph — Neutral East African Business Style

Use this as a benchmark for tone and rhythm:

> We wish to inform you that the training programme will commence on 3 March 2026 at our Nairobi office. Kindly confirm your availability at your earliest convenience. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your continued partnership and look forward to working together.

## When This Skill Applies

- **All visible website text** — headings, body copy, service descriptions, about pages, CTAs
- **Meta descriptions and SEO text**
- **Alt text for images** (clear, descriptive, respectful)
- **Error messages and form labels** (polite, never terse)
- **Any generated email templates or contact responses**

This skill runs alongside every other skill. The design-system chooses how text looks; this skill governs what it says and how it sounds.
