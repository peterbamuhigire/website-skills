# Skills-engine control-plane adoption

This repository exposes the website-skills engine through the declarative .skills-engine/engine-manifest.yaml contract.

The engine remains independently usable. Its router and domain SKILL.md files are authoritative. Universal coordination may read the router, discover skills, inspect Git, and review declared validators.

Missing dependency, platform, source, or approval evidence is NOT ASSESSED. Writes, pulls, publication, submissions, ledger/filing changes, deployment, and control changes require explicit approval.

MCP-safe operations are read-only discovery, router read, skill read, and documented-check inspection. Forks are inspected from their own checkout; no validator is invented when the repository is not catalogued.
