## 60-30-10 Rule Psychology

This distribution creates visual hierarchy that feels natural to the brain:

- **60% Primary Color**: Sets overall mood, context, feeling
- **30% Secondary Color**: Supports primary, provides balance
- **10% Accent Color**: Draws attention, directs action

**Psychological effect**: Eye naturally follows this distribution; anything violating it feels wrong. Users don't consciously notice proper proportion but feel discomfort with improper ratios.

## Color Combinations That Signal Quality

**High quality/premium:**
- Muted colors on white space
- Complementary but desaturated pairs
- Generous white space around color
- Dark text on light background (high contrast)

**Low quality/budget:**
- Bright saturated colors everywhere (no breathing room)
- Colors that clash (poor harmony)
- Thin text on colored backgrounds (poor contrast)
- Too many colors (visual chaos)

**Key Takeaway**: Psychology matters, but context matters more. Know the psychology of individual colors, but always let your industry, brand, and target audience guide selection. Test with real users when possible.
